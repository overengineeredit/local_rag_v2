## Blocked Tasks
- None currently

## Task Dependencies
- TASK-002 â†’ TASK-003 (systemd config needed for packaging)
- TASK-004, TASK-005, TASK-006 â†’ TASK-009 (core components needed for health check)
- TASK-006 â†’ TASK-007 (API must exist before CLI can communicate with it)
- TASK-017 â†’ TASK-018, TASK-019 (PR validation workflow needed before build automation)
- TASK-020 â†’ TASK-017 (test pipeline needed for PR validation)
- TASK-003 â†’ TASK-018 (APT packaging process needed for automated builds)

## Definition of Done (Per Task)
1. Implementation complete with TODO markers removed
2. Unit tests written with >85% coverage for the component
3. Integration test passes (where applicable)  
4. Documentation updated in relevant spec files
5. Code passes `ruff check .` linting
6. Manual testing validates acceptance criteria

## Notes
- All tasks align with milestone deliverables in `specs/04_milestones.md`
- Task status tracked in this file, updated weekly
- Critical path: TASK-004, TASK-005, TASK-006 must complete before milestone 1 delivery
- Resource limits (TASK-016) moved to milestone 2 per complexity assessment
