# Implementation Tasks (LEGACY)

> **⚠️ NOTICE**: This file contains legacy task tracking. Active task management has moved to the SpecKit structure.  
> **Current Tasks**: See `specs/001-local-rag-mvp/tasks.md` for the active, up-to-date task breakdown.  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-10-12  
> **Status**: ARCHIVED - Replaced by SpecKit user story-based task organization

## Migration Notice

The project has transitioned to a SpecKit-compliant structure with improved task organization:

- **New Task File**: `specs/001-local-rag-mvp/tasks.md`
- **Organization**: Tasks are now organized by user story for independent delivery
- **Enhanced Features**: Includes dual hash strategy, change detection, and improved content management
- **Better Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with contract, integration, and BDD tests

### Key Improvements in New Task Structure

- ✅ User story-based organization for independent development and testing
- ✅ Enhanced content management with source-aware change detection
- ✅ Dual hash strategy (source + content) for better deduplication
- ✅ Update checking without re-import capabilities
- ✅ Comprehensive API design with OpenAPI specification
- ✅ Improved CLI with rich terminal interface

## Blocked Tasks

- None currently

## Task Dependencies

- TASK-002 → TASK-003 (systemd config needed for packaging)
- TASK-004, TASK-005, TASK-006 → TASK-009 (core components needed for health check)
- TASK-006 → TASK-007 (API must exist before CLI can communicate with it)
- TASK-017 → TASK-018, TASK-019 (PR validation workflow needed before build automation)
- TASK-020 → TASK-017 (test pipeline needed for PR validation)
- TASK-003 → TASK-018 (APT packaging process needed for automated builds)

## Definition of Done (Per Task)

1. Implementation complete with TODO markers removed
2. Unit tests written with >85% coverage for the component
