# Risk Assessment and Mitigation

## High Priority Risks

### 1. Resource Exhaustion on Pi5
**Risk**: Limited RAM/CPU on Pi5 could cause system instability or poor performance
**Impact**: High - System unusable or unreliable
**Probability**: Medium - Pi5 has resource constraints

**Mitigation**:
- Implement configurable resource limits via environment variables
- Add memory monitoring with graceful degradation
- Use streaming responses to minimize memory peaks
- Choose optimized model sizes (1-3B parameters max)
- Implement resource usage logging and alerts

### 2. Model Performance and Quality
**Risk**: Small LLMs may provide poor response quality or hallucinate frequently
**Impact**: High - Poor user experience, unreliable answers
**Probability**: Medium - Inherent limitation of small models

**Mitigation**:
- Use retrieval-augmented generation to ground responses
- Implement prompt engineering to reduce hallucination
- Choose well-reviewed models (DeepSeek R1, Llama variants)
- Add response quality logging for continuous improvement
- Provide clear disclaimers about limitations

### 3. Thermal Management
**Risk**: Continuous LLM inference could cause thermal throttling on Pi5
**Impact**: Medium - Reduced performance, potential hardware damage
**Probability**: Medium - ARM CPUs generate heat under load

**Mitigation**:
- Monitor CPU temperature via system APIs
- Implement thermal throttling in application layer
- Use efficient inference parameters (lower thread count if needed)
- Recommend proper cooling solutions in documentation
- Add temperature monitoring to health checks

### 4. Data Integrity and Corruption
**Risk**: Power loss or system crashes could corrupt ChromaDB or model files
**Impact**: High - Data loss, system unusable
**Probability**: Low-Medium - Pi5 systems may have unstable power

**Mitigation**:
- Use ChromaDB's built-in durability features
- Implement atomic operations for critical data updates
- Add database integrity checks on startup
- Provide backup/restore functionality via CLI
- Use journaling filesystem recommendations

### 5. Cross-Architecture Compatibility
**Risk**: APT packages or dependencies may not work consistently across ARM64/AMD64
**Impact**: Medium - Deployment failures, user frustration
**Probability**: Medium - Cross-compilation can be complex

**Mitigation**:
- Build and test packages on both architectures
- Use CI/CD with multi-arch build environments
- Pin dependency versions for consistency
- Provide architecture-specific documentation
- Test on real hardware, not just emulation

## Medium Priority Risks

### 6. Package Installation Complexity
**Risk**: APT package dependencies or systemd integration may fail
**Impact**: Medium - Installation difficulties, user support burden
**Probability**: Medium - System integration can be fragile

**Mitigation**:
- Thoroughly test installation on clean systems
- Provide comprehensive pre-installation checks
- Include detailed troubleshooting documentation
- Use standard Debian packaging practices
- Implement rollback capability for failed installs

### 7. Content Import Failures
**Risk**: Large imports may fail mid-process, leaving inconsistent state
**Impact**: Medium - Data loss, user frustration
**Probability**: Medium - Network/disk issues during imports

**Mitigation**:
- Implement resumable import operations
- Use transaction-like semantics for batch operations
- Provide detailed import progress and error reporting
- Add import validation and integrity checks
- Store import state for recovery

### 8. Network Connectivity Issues
**Risk**: URL-based content ingestion may fail due to network issues
**Impact**: Low-Medium - Some content sources unavailable
**Probability**: Medium - Network reliability varies

**Mitigation**:
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Provide clear error messages for network failures
- Add timeout configurations for network operations
- Support offline content preparation
- Cache successful downloads when possible

## Low Priority Risks

### 9. Security and Access Control
**Risk**: Local web interface accessible to network, potential data exposure
**Impact**: Low-Medium - Privacy concerns (future consideration)
**Probability**: Low - Designed for single-user local access

**Mitigation**:
- Bind web interface to localhost by default
- Document security considerations for network access
- Prepare authentication hooks for future implementation
- Monitor for security best practices in dependencies
- Provide guidance on network security

### 10. Model Licensing and Distribution
**Risk**: Selected models may have licensing restrictions
**Impact**: Low-Medium - Legal compliance issues
**Probability**: Low - Using open-source models

**Mitigation**:
- Carefully review model licenses before inclusion
- Document licensing requirements clearly
- Provide model download instructions rather than bundling
- Use only commercially-friendly open source models
- Maintain license compliance documentation

### 11. Long-term Maintenance
**Risk**: Dependencies may become outdated or incompatible
**Impact**: Medium - System becomes unmaintainable
**Probability**: Medium - Python ecosystem changes rapidly

**Mitigation**:
- Pin dependency versions in requirements
- Implement automated dependency update testing
- Use widely-adopted, stable libraries
- Document upgrade procedures
- Plan for periodic dependency refreshes

## Risk Monitoring

**Key Metrics to Track**:
- System resource usage (RAM, CPU, disk, temperature)
- Response times and quality indicators
- Installation success rates across platforms
- Import failure rates and recovery success
- User-reported issues and resolution times

**Review Schedule**:
- Weekly: Resource usage and performance metrics
- Monthly: User feedback and issue trends
- Quarterly: Dependency updates and security review
- Annually: Architecture and technology stack review

## Contingency Plans

**Critical System Failure**:
1. Provide system reset CLI command
2. Maintain backup installation packages
3. Document manual recovery procedures
4. Plan for data export/import functionality

**Performance Degradation**:
1. Implement automatic resource scaling
2. Provide performance tuning documentation
3. Offer model size downgrade options
4. Plan hardware upgrade recommendations
