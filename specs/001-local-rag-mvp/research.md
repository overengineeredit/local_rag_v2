# Research Findings: Local RAG System

**Branch**: `001-local-rag-mvp` | **Date**: 2025-10-28
**Phase**: 0 - Research and Clarification

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. LLM Integration via llama-cpp-python

**Decision**: Use llama-cpp-python with GGUF model format
**Rationale**: 
- Native Python bindings for llama.cpp provide optimal performance
- GGUF format supports quantization for memory efficiency
- Proven compatibility with ARM64 and AMD64 architectures
- Streaming token support built-in
- No external server dependencies

**Alternatives considered**:
- Transformers library: Higher memory usage, slower inference on CPU
- OpenAI-compatible local servers: Additional complexity, resource overhead
- Direct llama.cpp: Requires C++ integration, more complex

### 2. Vector Database Selection

**Decision**: ChromaDB with embedded SQLite backend
**Rationale**:
- Embedded mode eliminates server management complexity
- SQLite backend ensures data persistence and reliability
- Built-in similarity search and metadata filtering
- Python-native integration
- Supports document chunking and embedding management

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pinecone: Requires internet connectivity, cloud dependency
- Weaviate: Server-based, higher resource requirements
- FAISS: Lower-level, requires additional persistence layer

### 3. Web Framework Selection

**Decision**: FastAPI with Uvicorn ASGI server
**Rationale**:
- High-performance async framework suitable for streaming responses
- Automatic API documentation generation
- Built-in validation with Pydantic models
- WebSocket support for real-time UI updates
- Lightweight compared to Django/Flask

**Alternatives considered**:
- Flask: Synchronous, less suitable for streaming
- Django: Over-engineered for single-user embedded application
- Tornado: Lower-level, more complex implementation

### 4. Packaging and Distribution

**Decision**: APT/Debian packaging with systemd integration
**Rationale**:
- Native Linux package management integration
- Automatic dependency resolution
- systemd service ensures proper startup/shutdown
- Standard installation path conventions (/etc/, /var/lib/)
- Cross-architecture support (ARM64/AMD64)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Docker: Additional overhead, less suitable for embedded devices
- Snap packages: Slower startup, higher resource usage
- Python wheels: No system service integration

### 5. Content Processing Pipeline

**Decision**: Modular content processor with pluggable handlers
**Rationale**:
- Support for multiple input formats (text, HTML, URLs)
- Extensible design for future content types
- Consistent chunking strategy across formats
- Content hash-based deduplication
- Metadata preservation through processing pipeline

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single monolithic processor: Less flexible, harder to test
- External processing tools: Additional dependencies, complexity

### 6. Configuration Management

**Decision**: YAML configuration with environment variable overrides
**Rationale**:
- Human-readable configuration format
- Hierarchical structure for complex settings
- Environment variable overrides for deployment flexibility
- Validation using Pydantic models
- Default configuration embedded in application

**Alternatives considered**:
- JSON configuration: Less human-friendly for complex configs
- TOML configuration: Less widely adopted, fewer libraries
- Environment variables only: Difficult for complex configurations

### 7. CLI Interface Design

**Decision**: Rich CLI with API communication backend
**Rationale**:
- Consistent behavior with web interface (both use API)
- Rich terminal formatting for better user experience
- Progress bars and status indicators for long operations
- Error handling with actionable messages
- Command structure follows standard Unix conventions

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct database access: Bypasses validation and business logic
- Separate CLI backend: Code duplication, inconsistent behavior

## Architecture Decisions

### Embedding Strategy
- Use text-embedding model integrated with ChromaDB
- Chunk size: 512 tokens with 50 token overlap
- Store original text with embeddings for retrieval context
- Metadata includes source, timestamp, and content hash

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when components unavailable
- Retry logic for transient failures
- User-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of LLM models to reduce startup time
- Embedding batch processing for bulk imports
- Memory-mapped model loading where supported
- Configurable resource limits with monitoring
