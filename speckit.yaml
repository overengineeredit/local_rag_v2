  # Core project goals and constraints
  goals:
    - Portable, offline RAG system with local LLM inference
    - Intelligent content management with source-aware change detection
    - Cross-platform support (Pi5 ARM64, AMD64)
    - CPU-first approach with llama-cpp-python
    - Single-command APT package installation
    - Privacy-first design with no cloud dependencies
    - Efficient update detection using dual hash strategy (source + content)
    - Cross-source deduplication with metadata preservation
    
  non_goals:
    - Cloud inference or remote model hosting
    - Hardware-specific acceleration (NPU/GPU) in v1
    - Multi-user or enterprise authentication
    - Real-time collaboration features
    - Container-based deployment
