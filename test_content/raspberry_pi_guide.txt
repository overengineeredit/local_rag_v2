Raspberry Pi 5 Setup Guide

The Raspberry Pi 5 is a powerful single-board computer perfect for edge computing applications. Here are the key specifications:

System Requirements:
- RAM: 4GB or 8GB LPDDR4X-4267 SDRAM
- Storage: microSD card (Class 10, 32GB minimum recommended)
- Power: 5V/5A USB-C power supply
- Operating Temperature: 0°C to 85°C
- CPU: Quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 processor running at 2.4GHz

Installation Steps:
1. Flash the Raspberry Pi OS to a microSD card using the Raspberry Pi Imager
2. Insert the microSD card into the Pi 5
3. Connect peripherals (keyboard, mouse, monitor)
4. Connect the USB-C power supply
5. The Pi will boot automatically

For Local RAG deployment:
- Ensure adequate cooling to prevent thermal throttling
- Use a high-quality microSD card or SSD for better performance
- Configure systemd services for automatic startup
- Monitor CPU temperature during inference operations

The Pi 5 supports both ARM64 and legacy applications, making it ideal for running local AI workloads while maintaining privacy and data sovereignty.
