Local RAG Troubleshooting Guide

Common Issues and Solutions:

Installation Problems:
Q: Package installation fails with dependency errors
A: Ensure you're using Python 3.11+ and run: pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

Q: ChromaDB fails to initialize 
A: Check that the data directory is writable and has sufficient disk space

Q: LLM model fails to load
A: Verify the GGUF file is not corrupted and matches the expected hash
   Check available RAM - models require 4-8GB depending on size

Performance Issues:
Q: Query responses are very slow
A: This is normal for CPU inference. Check:
   - CPU temperature (should be < 75°C)
   - Available RAM (should have 2GB+ free)
   - Model size (try smaller quantized models)

Q: System becomes unresponsive during inference
A: Enable thermal throttling in configuration
   Reduce the number of CPU threads used for inference
   Consider using a smaller model variant

Content Import Issues:
Q: Documents aren't being found during search
A: Verify content was imported successfully:
   - Check the import logs for errors
   - Ensure document chunking completed
   - Test with exact phrases from the documents

Q: Duplicate content keeps appearing
A: The dual hash system should prevent this:
   - Check if source files have actually changed
   - Review content normalization settings
   - Consider clearing and re-importing if corruption occurred

Network and Connectivity:
Q: CLI commands fail with connection errors
A: Ensure the FastAPI server is running:
   - Check systemctl status local-rag
   - Verify port 8080 is not blocked
   - Test with curl http://localhost:8080/health

For additional support, check the system logs:
- journalctl -u local-rag -f (service logs)
- tail -f /var/log/local-rag/app.log (application logs)
